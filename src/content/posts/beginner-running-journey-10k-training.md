From never running a single kilometer to training for my first 10K - this is my story of how it all began, what I learned, and how running slowly became a part of my life.

Let me tell you something about myself-I was never a runner. Not even close. I wasn't the person who ran during school sports or planned to "run someday." Honestly, the only times I ran were because my mom made me.

So how did someone like me end up running on her own, anytime, anywhere-and actually enjoying it? Let's go back to where it all began.

### 🌄 How It All Started-The Trek That Sparked It

In February 2025, my partner and I came across a Himalayan trek that required a certain level of fitness. They even asked for proof-a 5 km run completed within a specific time limit depending on trek difficulty.

That became my motivation. I wanted to do the trek, so I had to run.

The first thing I did? Buy proper running shoes. I took advice from a friend who's an experienced runner and ended up buying the "ASICS GEL KAYANO 31 Women Textured Lace-Ups Running Sports Shoes". They're amazing-super comfortable, great cushioning, and the laces don't come undone like my old ones.

### 👟 Finding My Running Community-"Sisters In Sweat"

Once I had my shoes, it was time to start. I began by walking, and one day while talking about my plan to run, a friend mentioned a women's running community called [Sisters In Sweat](https://sistersinsweat.com).

They host Sunday runs at Cubbon Park, led by a coach named Adit-and he's incredible.

I joined a few Sunday runs where I mostly walked and jogged, starting with 3 km. Soon, the community launched a new structured training program that was starting in June. I signed up immediately.

### 💪 Building Consistency-My First Training Program

That training package changed everything. I joined the June to September 2025 batch, and those three months completely reshaped my routine. I made running my top priority - planning my days around training sessions. Even if I missed a class, I'd make up for it later in the day.

Over time, I started noticing actual changes - not overnight, but slow and steady. My stamina improved, my mood lifted, and I felt stronger. I even started waking up early twice a week for those 6AM sessions - something I never imagined doing before.

By the end of the program, I had lost around 2 kg, and my VO₂ Max improved from 24 to 26 according to my Apple Watch.

Since I was already doing strength training and eating a balanced diet, running added that missing spark - I felt lighter, more energetic, and mentally more focused.

Even though I was the slowest runner in my group, it never bothered me. I stayed consistent and kept pushing myself every single session. By the end of the 3-month program, I could run 9.15 km in 1 hour 27 minutes, and that felt amazing.

### 🏅 Next Goal-My First 10K Race

After months of training, consistency, 5 AM wake-ups, and showing up even on the slow days, my next big goal was my first ever 10K - the Kaveri Trail Marathon.

And now that the run is done, here's how race day really went for me:

Race day started with only 4 hours of sleep because our car broke down the previous night. I reached the venue about 10 minutes late, so I didn't get to warm up - maybe there was a warm-up happening, maybe not - but I just had to start running immediately.

The first few kilometres felt surprisingly good. I went slowly, found my rhythm, and pushed a little whenever I had energy.
But the last stretch was very hard. I almost dragged myself to the finish line. Still, I'm proud I showed up, ran, and completed my first 10K despite the messy start. According to the tracker, I finished in 1:33 hrs, my first personal best.

**What I learned for next time:**

- Keep enough buffer time to reach the hotel one day prior to avoid any last-minute chaos
- Keep buffer time before the race
- Do my own warm-up, mobility and stretches

This race wasn't perfect, but it was real - and it taught me exactly what I needed to learn for my next goal.

### 💡 Lessons I've Learned as a Beginner Runner

Running has taught me so much. Here are a few key lessons I've learned along the way:

- 🏃‍♀️ Even a small jog or walk is better than doing nothing at all.
- 🐢 Don't rush. Slow jogging and a consistent pace are better than trying to run fast early on.
- 🏋️‍♀️ Do strength training. It supports your joints and improves endurance.
- 💧Hydration and nutrition are non-negotiable.
- 😴 Sleep well. Recovery is part of training.
- 💆‍♀️ Get regular massages. A deep-tissue massage every month really helps relax sore muscles.
- 🩺 See a physiotherapist if you have pain. It's normal to get minor injuries-don't be afraid. Follow your physio's advice and come back stronger.

I tweaked my ankle early on, and it freaked me out. Luckily, my physio helped me out, and I could keep going safely. Injury is part of any physical journey-what matters is how you handle it.

### 🧘‍♀️ What I Learned About Running Form

If you're new to running, having a coach really helps. I learned the importance of posture and form, like:

- Keep your core engaged
- Move your hands alongside your body-they help with momentum
- Your foot should land under your knee (shorter steps help!)
- Keep your shoulders relaxed and upright

You don't have to start with a coach forever-but start right. A community or a coach helps you build correct habits, stay motivated, and avoid injuries.

### 🌻 My Advice for Beginners

- If you're not into strength training yet, don't run beyond 5 km.
- Gradually build your distance-your body needs time to adapt.
- Don't sign up for a marathon without training.
- And most importantly, run for yourself. Not for pace, not for others-for the joy it brings.
