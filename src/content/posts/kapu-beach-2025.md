Between golden sunsets and gentle winds, I found calm on Udupi's Kapu Beach. This slow travel escape was everything I didn't know I needed.

As I sit on the balcony, the sound of waves fills the air, the wind brushes past, and the lighthouse throws its beam across the dark ocean. I'm thinking about the past three days here - tomorrow morning, I'll be leaving for Bangalore, but a piece of my heart will stay back in Udupi.

### **🧘‍♀️Why We Chose Udupi**

The past four months have been a blur - running, driving, working, learning, managing the home, training. I was exhausted. I told my partner I needed a break - and he, being the caring and pampering soul he is, immediately started looking for a calm place where I could truly unwind. Through one of his friends, we found this beautiful beachside homestay in Udupi.

Our idea of a vacation is simple: find a beach, stay close to it, and just be. No checklist, no rushing through tourist spots. We love slow travel - letting the place reveal itself in its own time.

### **🏠 The Stay: A Beachside Home at Kapu**

Honestly, I didn't even check the photos. I just knew it was a home by the beach. When we arrived and I peeked from the side of the house, I saw the waves - not even 50 meters away! For two straight hours, I just stood by the window, watching the sea and thinking, "This close? Really?" 😂.

We flew to Mangalore Airport and took a cab from there. The host was incredibly helpful - she sent every little detail beforehand, from cab contacts to food and local tips.

The house itself felt like visiting your grandparents' coastal home - an old two-storey house with a porch, a kitchen, a fridge, a washing machine, surrounded by greenery and the soft rhythm of village life. This was a fisherman's village - gentle, kind people who worship the ocean. Everywhere you look, there are boats resting on sand, and that constant salty breeze.

### **🌅 Day 1: Arrival & Golden Sunset**

We dropped our bags, refreshed, rested for a while and walked straight to the beach. The golden sunset was pure magic - my soul felt happy and smiling. I collected seashells and stones like a child who couldn't stop.

After a simple home-cooked meal (sent by the sweet local aunty), I sat on the porch and listened to the waves.

I'm sound-sensitive, so I kept waking up to the crashing waves, thinking it was raining outside - but soon that sound became oddly comforting.

### **☀️ Day 2: From Morning Unwinding to Tasty Food and Coastal Adventures**

By the next morning, it already felt like home. The sweet local aunty sent Neer dosa for breakfast; I made tea and sat on the porch. I could feel my mind slowly unwinding - the to-do lists, the rush, everything fading into calm.

Later, we explored the nearby areas in an auto arranged by our host - a beautiful route with a beach on one side and backwaters on the other.

We stopped for lunch at the Mahalakshmi Hotel (near Malpe harbour) - hands down, one of the best fish fries I've ever had. If you're a seafood lover, this place is heaven.

Then came a sea walk at Malpe Beach, a lazy coffee at a beachside cafe, and finally a motorboat ride to St. Mary's Island - a 15-minute adventure over glistening waters.

**🪨 St. Mary's Island: Where Time Stands Still**

St. Mary's Island is not just scenic - it's ancient and poetic. Around 88 million years ago, when Madagascar drifted away from India, these unique columnar basalt rocks formed.

And if that wasn't fascinating enough, Vasco da Gama landed here in 1498, named it O Padrão de Santa Maria, and left a cross - giving the island its name.

Standing there, surrounded by endless ocean and golden light, I couldn't help but feel tiny and grateful.

### **🌤️ Day 3: Morning Walks & Lighthouse Views**

I woke up early, excited to catch the sunrise - only to realize the sun doesn't rise from this seaside 😄. Still, it was worth it - the soft morning air, fishermen pulling their boats ashore, and strangers exchanging gentle smiles made it magical.

![Sunrise from other side](/assets/kapu-beach/sunrise-from-other-side.png "Sunrise from other side")

Back home, I brewed some tea and sat on the porch with my partner - singing songs, taking random pictures, jumping around like a kid, and just existing. Every now and then, I'd wander to the beach, walk barefoot on the sand, and come back with sandy feet and wide smiles. Until about 3 o'clock, we were just there - talking, reading, laughing, and enjoying the peaceful silence that only comes when you're truly relaxed.

That evening, we visited the Kapu Lighthouse, built in 1901 by the British to guide ships. Standing 27 meters tall, it still watches over the sea with quiet dignity. Climbing those 150 narrow stairs wasn't tough at all - all thanks to my fitness journey that began in February 2025. (If you've read my [running blog](https://www.trapti.dev/blog/beginner-running-journey-10k-training), you already know how much that journey has boosted my stamina!). Once at the top, the wind was wild, the view endless, and the sunset absolutely unforgettable.

We walked home through the sleepy lanes of the village, the sound of the waves still following us.

### **💬 The Running Joke**

Throughout the entire trip, our running joke was about how much I loved the place.

> I kept telling my partner, "Can we just buy a house here? I'm such a beach baby - born to live by the sea!"

> He laughed and said, "You? You were born in a place with no mountains or beaches!" 🤣.

Honestly, he's right - but my heart belongs to the ocean.

### **🌴 Planning Your Own Slow Travel to Udupi**

**How to Reach:** Fly to Mangalore Airport, then take a cab (around 1.5 hours) to Kapu Beach. Cost Rs. 1800. Or take a direct train or car ride.

**Where to Stay:** Look for beachside homestays in Kapu - they're affordable, local, and peaceful. Here is the link of where we stayed. [Propert we stayed at](https://knowheretravel.co/property/seas-the-day/)

**Stay dates and whether:** We were there from 5th - 8th Nov 2025. The weather was pleasant - windy, humidity yes, but not extreme.

**What to Do:**

- Enjoy living like a local at Kapu Beach.
- Enjoy local food.
- Visit Malpe Beach and St. Mary's Island ⛵. We just did this, but there are many places like temples, museums, etc.
- Try seafood at the Mahalakshmi Hotel 🍤 and other places too; seafood is superb here.

### **🎬 The K-Drama Connection 😂**

My stay here reminded me so much of the Korean show **"Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha."** It's a heartwarming love story set in a seaside village, where life moves slowly, laughter echoes often, and kindness is a way of life.

Kapu felt like the _Indian version_ of that show - calm, cozy, and full of heart. 😂

And as a big K-Drama fan, I swear, at one point I was waiting for background music to play and a hero to appear fixing a fishing net 😂. Guess my life just missed its _slow-travel-rom-com moment!_

### **💭 Before You Go**

If you ever visit Udupi, don't rush. Let it unfold slowly - one wave, one meal, one golden sunset at a time.
