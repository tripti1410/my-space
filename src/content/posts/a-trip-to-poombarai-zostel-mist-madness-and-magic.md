So this was my second Zostel trip — and let me say it upfront, I _love_ Zostel. Booked a stay in the female dorm with my friend. Because what’s better than bunk beds, strangers who become friends, and that good old bachelor vibe I’ve always missed?

### The Zostel Life

A younger crowd, music, laughter, and bonfire storytelling—the unofficial national pastime of hostels—instantly greeted us. People were dancing, jamming, and bonding like we were all in some indie movie. Total vibes.

Zostel had organized **three activities**, and obviously, we signed up for all. Go hard or go home, right?

### 1. Kookal Village — Off-roading, Rain, and a Hidden Waterfall

We set off in the evening to catch the sunset at Kookal Village — a mix of misty hills, pine forests, and “I’m-in-a-dream” type scenery.

**Plot twist:** It rained. But the romantic, movie-scene rain that makes the whole place even prettier (and you wet and muddy).

The jeep dropped us at the top of a hill. From there, a little 1 km trail led us to a rock ledge where we clicked photos and soaked in the view.

Then, my new buddy and I wandered further down — and guess what? A **massive, lush waterfall** appeared like a nature surprise gift. Sadly, no photo. I didn’t carry my phone. _Rookie mistake._

Climbing back up? UFF. Leaning on a stick, I gossiped with my friend as we walked back. That stick saved lives.

### 2. Morning Waterfall Walk — Nature’s Ice Bucket Challenge

This one was just 1.5 km away from Zostel. A short walk with fresh faces, lots of chatter, and host-led fun.

The waterfall is on private property, so permission is a must. The trail narrows down to a one-person path, and suddenly, two boys ahead of us stop — why?

Turns out the waterfall was already in use by a bunch of guys, _in full bachelor mode_ (read: not enough clothes). We patiently waited while they scrambled to get decent. 😅

The water was _freezing_. Like “my toes are crying” cold. We started with dipping our feet and slowly leveled up. I went under the falls, slipped a little (gracefully, I like to believe), and just stood there — pure, freezing water washing over me. Nature’s spa, no appointment needed!

Walked back to Zostel soaked like a sponge, but totally worth it.

### 3. Palambatur Off-Roading — Thrills, Chills & Sandwiches

This one? WILD.

We hopped into a truck headed to Palambatur, a hidden spot with lush green trails, mist, and beautiful views. I sat in the front seat (neck issues, not bravery), while others stood in the back truck bed like action heroes.

Our driver? Insane skills. At one point, muddy water splashed over the entire windshield. I swear I saw my life flash before me. But also, the ride gave us some of the best views of the trip.

The jeep climbed up where there were no roads. Just bushes on both sides, a little flat patch where we parked, and then we hiked to the top.

Up there? Peace. Silence. Sandwiches. A stunning sunset. A full-on Bollywood ending.

We stayed, soaked in the stillness, took dreamy pictures, and then headed back under a moonlit sky.

### Final Thoughts

Zostel Poombarai delivered what I came for — new friends, spontaneous plans, nature’s chaos, and some solid stories.

**Things that could be better:**

- Food (just okay).
- More taxi options for local travel.

**Logistics:**

- Train from Bangalore to Kodaikanal Road.
- 3-hour taxi to Zostel (₹3600).
- Return via cab to Kodai bus stand, then bus to Bangalore.

A different trip. The kind you think about later and smile like a goof.
