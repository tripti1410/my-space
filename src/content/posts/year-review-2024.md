![Highlight of my year](/assets/year-review-2024/collage.jpg "Collage of my best images of this year")

2024 was... a lot. It started with a continuation of some personal challenges—taking care of a loved one’s health. There were so many ups and downs, moments of uncertainty, and endless travels. It was emotionally and physically draining, but looking back now, I can say we made it through.

I’m so grateful to God for helping us reach the other side of this journey. It wasn’t the year we had planned, but it taught me resilience, strength, and just how important health and family are.

### Work Wins

One of the highlights of this year was starting my new job at **Stellr** as a Staff Frontend Engineer in January. Honestly, it felt like fate. I had applied back in 2023 when life was hectic and forgot all about it. Then, out of nowhere in December, I got a call for an interview. Four rounds later, I got the job!

Working at Stellr has been amazing. The company, my team, the work—it’s all been so supportive and manageable. It’s given me the balance I needed during a tough time.

Here are a few of my work highlights this year:

- Got recognized by my team a couple of times, which felt great.
- Designed a mobile app! It didn’t go into production, but it was a big confidence boost and a chance to put my skills to the test.
- Picked up a bunch of new skills: **Next.js, Figma, Cypress, AWS, GraphQL**, and algorithms!

### Creative Side

This year, I also made time for creative projects. I worked on improving my skills and managed to put out:

- **5 blogs**
- **4 long-form YouTube videos**
- **8 YouTube shorts**

It’s not a huge amount, but considering how much was going on, I’m proud of it! Plus, I redesigned my portfolio and added an **About page** and a **Video page**—small wins, but they feel good.

Created many drawing but this one is best

### Empowering Moments

One of my favorite things this year was attending **women’s meetups**. These were so inspiring! I got to share my own journey and listen to other women talk about their experiences—both personal and professional. It was a reminder of how strong and resilient we all are and how important it is to lift each other up.

### Big Personal Wins

On the personal side, 2024 was a huge year:

- **We bought a house!**: This has been a dream of mine since I was a kid, and now it’s real. My partner and I bought a big house, and I handled the loan and all the processes, which was super empowering.
- **Got my finances in order**: I hired a financial planner, which was a game-changer. It reduced so much anxiety about the future and gave me clarity. I also took term insurance—it was a process, but I’m glad it’s done.

### What I Read

I didn’t read as much as I’d hoped, but I made progress with some great books this year:

- _The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari_
- _The Light We Carry_
- _Deep Work_ (still reading!)
- _Masala Lab_ (also still reading!)
- _The Staff Engineer’s Path_ (in progress)
- _Writing Well_

### Travel Highlights

Even with everything going on, I managed to squeeze in some trips, and they were all so refreshing:

- **Kochi**
- **Varkala** (I even wrote a blog about this trip—check it out [here](/blog/varkala-south-cliff-kerala/))
- **Guwahati**

Travel is always such a great way to reset, and these trips were no exception.

### Friends, Family & Bonds

This year, I focused on spending time with the people who matter most to me. I strengthened bonds with old friends, formed some incredible new ones, and made memories I’ll always treasure. Genuine connections are so important to me, and I put a lot of effort into building and nurturing them.

### Looking Back

2024 was tough, no doubt about it. But it was also a year of growth, gratitude, and some really big wins. From starting a new job at Stellr to buying a house to working on creative projects, I’m proud of how far I’ve come.

Here’s to carrying the lessons and memories of this year into 2025. Let’s see what the new year has in store!
