Summary of the book which I felt very relevant and inspiring.

**Rejection**

- when ambition is involved, rejection is almost inevitable.
- Over the years, I have learnt not to limit my definition of success to a single option, because I have experienced the power of option B
- If there arenâ€™t times when you feel frustrated, if you donâ€™t feel pushed against the wall, then you are not aiming high enough
- Zoom out. What feels like a big blot today will be a small dot tomorrow.

**Feedback**

- tough criticism from the right people is a friend request you should not ignore
- Tough feedback is not necessarily a sign that we are incompetent or disliked; it is often a statement that shows we have a long way to go and that some people are ready to invest their time to help us get there.
- Building a resilient career is not very different from building a robust company. When feedback and criticism send you that friend request, accept it with open arms

**Beyond hard work: improve your multiple**

_The magic is in the doing of simple things repeatedly and long enough to ignite the miracle of the compound effect. - darren hardly_

Having clarity and conviction about what you are and what you are not is a potent source of power.

There is no need to do treading or popular things. Standing for something different is a good way to stand out.

**Networking**-Neki kar aur dariya me dal

**Confidence: confront the mirror**

- When you change how you see things, what you see changes. Many a time, you donâ€™t need to change your situation; you just need to change how you approach it.
- When you say something from honest and from your heart it reaches to the audience.
- it is good to know your natural game and always play the natural game

**Work life balance: get off the see-saw**

_You canâ€™t have everything and do everything at the same time -Oprah_

Work life balance is myth, our work and life are mostly combined. It cannot be balance always in 50-50 ratio. We need to find integration between them. Sometimes if work requires ðŸ’¯ then go for it later rest and vice versa.

**Advisory boards: build your tribe**

If you want to go fast, go alone, but if you want to go far, go with others.

**Questions to think aboutÂ and answer.**

- Whatâ€™s your natural game?
- We need an internal mandate. It helps create purpose.

  1. What are the times at work that have made me deeply unhappy, so miserable that I havenâ€™t found the basic motivation to perform?

  2. Which are the moments in my career that have inspired me?

- What I saw myself doing in five, 10 and 20 years?
- The skills required to do above and which once you have?
