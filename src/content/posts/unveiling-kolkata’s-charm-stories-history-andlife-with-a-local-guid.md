When my friend invited me to her wedding in Kolkata, I knew it wasnâ€™t just about the big dayâ€”it was about the city, the chaos, the culture, and the unexpected moments that make travel so magical. We didnâ€™t have a detailed itinerary, just a place to stay near the wedding venue and a loose plan to figure things out as we went. Little did I know, Kolkata would sweep me off my feet in the most unexpected ways.

### The Wedding: Laughter, Love, and a Little Blackmail

The journey to Kolkata was exhausting, but the warmth of my friendâ€™s family instantly made up for it. After freshening up, we dove headfirst into the festivitiesâ€”starting with the Mehndi ceremony. Laughter, delicious food, and meeting new people filled the evening.

The wedding itself was a stunning Bengali affair, steeped in tradition. The rituals, the dÃ©cor, the foodâ€”everything was mesmerising. But the highlight? The garland exchange. Picture this: the bride being lifted on a wooden plank, her face a mix of terror and hilarity as everyone cheered. I managed to snap a photo of that priceless moment, and letâ€™s just say itâ€™s my golden ticket for some good-natured blackmail in the future. ðŸ˜œ

That evening, I made new friendsâ€”some from Madhya Pradesh, some locals from Kolkata. We wandered around Salt Lake City, chatting about life, love, and everything in between. It was one of those effortless connections that make travel so special.

### Exploring Kolkata: A Day of Temples, Toasts, and Timeless Art

The next day, we moved to a hotel closer to the cityâ€™s major attractions and booked a guided tour. After some online research, we found Muzaffar Khan from Tour de Kolkata, and he turned out to be the perfect guide for our adventure.

**Kalighat Temple:**

Our first stop was Kalighat Temple, one of Indiaâ€™s 51 Shakti Peethas. Our guide arranged for a â€˜pandaâ€™ (temple priest) to help us skip the long queue. While the spiritual significance was undeniable, the experience felt a bit commercialised, with priests pulling us inside aggressively. It wasnâ€™t the peaceful Darshana Iâ€™d hoped for, but it was an eye-opener nonetheless.

**Mother Teresaâ€™s House aka Motherâ€™s house as locals call it**

Next, we visited Mother Teresaâ€™s house. Standing in front of her humble room, seeing her preserved belongings, and learning about her life was incredibly moving. The simplicity of her spaceâ€”no fan, no luxuriesâ€”was a powerful reminder of her selflessness. We saw motherâ€™s tomb, mothers achievements her early life etc. A funny moment happened when one of the sisters jokingly said my husband and I looked like siblings. We laughed it off, but it added a light-hearted touch to an otherwise profound experience.

**A Taste of Kolkata:**

By then, we were starving. At a famous street shop (Konna dukaan), we tried Kachori with Aloo Sabzi, eaten like Pani Puriâ€”apparently the traditional way. We also had Malai Toast, a simple yet indulgent treat of toast topped with thick, creamy malai and sugar. It was the perfect fuel for the rest of our day.

**Kumartuli:**

Kumartuli was a revelation. This narrow street near the river is where artisans create stunning statues of Goddess Durga, Saraswati, and more. It felt like walking through an open-air art gallery. The intricate details of their work left me in awe, and I couldnâ€™t resist buying a few small souvenirs. Talking to one of the artists about their craft was a highlightâ€”their dedication and passion were truly inspiring. This was my favourite place amongst all.

We also stumbled upon a shop selling unique wooden artifacts made from sholapith, a material native to West Bengal and Odisha. The craftsmanship was exquisite, and I picked up a piece as a keepsake. For just â‚¹150, it felt like a steal.

**Victoria Memorial:**

Victoria Memorial was nextâ€”a grand, sprawling structure with a rich history. Since it was Republic Day, the museum was closed, but the park was open. Our guide worked some magic to get us tickets, and we learned about the memorialâ€™s history, including the 16-foot-tall statue with a trumpet that rotates in strong winds. Sadly, there wasnâ€™t enough wind that day to see it in action.

**St. Paulâ€™s Cathedral:**

This church was unlike any Iâ€™d seen before. Its history, including surviving a massive earthquake, was fascinating. The blend of Gothic architecture and resilience made it a memorable stop.

**Flower Market and Howrah Bridge:**

The flower market was a sensory overloadâ€”vibrant, crowded, and buzzing with energy. We bought flowers and used them as props for photos before walking across the iconic Howrah Bridge. The view of the Hooghly River was breathtaking.

**Indian Coffee House and College Street Book Market:**

The book market was closed (it was a Sunday), but we explored a few roadside shops and picked up four books. At Indian Coffee House, we soaked in the old-world charm, discussing its history and even Manna Deyâ€™s famous song inspired by this place. The food was average, but the tea and conversations made up for it.

**Prinsep Ghat:**

Our final stop was Prinsep Ghat, a serene spot by the river. Named after James Prinsep, the English scholar who translated ancient scripts, it was the perfect place to unwind. The suspension bridge nearby sparked my curiosity (thanks, DeepSeek, for the impromptu engineering lesson!). We spent the evening walking, sitting by the ghat, and soaking in the peaceful vibes.

### The Soul of Kolkata: A City That Stays With You

As we drove past Maidan, Fort William, and the colonial heritage buildings of White Town, I couldnâ€™t help but fall in love with Kolkata. The old buildings, yellow taxis, hand-pulled rickshaws, and trams painted a picture of a city thatâ€™s deeply rooted in history yet vibrantly alive.

Kolkata isnâ€™t just a city; itâ€™s an experience. Itâ€™s the warmth of its people, the richness of its culture, and the stories etched into every corner. Itâ€™s a place that stays with you long after youâ€™ve left. And as I boarded my flight back home, I knew this wouldnâ€™t be my last visit. Kolkata had captured my heart.

This experience wouldnâ€™t have been the same without our tour guide, Mr. Muzaffar Khan. Heâ€™s such a knowledgeable and kind person, and it was amazing to get to know him. We had so many great conversations with him about history, his life, our lives, and just life in general. One thing he said I will share here.

### A Night to Remember: Food, Friends, and Fears

After the tour, we freshened up and met a Kolkata-native friend at Peter Cat, a famous restaurant on Park Street. The Chelo Kabab and fish dish were divineâ€”unfortunately, I was too busy savouring the flavours to take pictures. ðŸ˜…

Later, we headed to Hashtag, a nearby pub. Though they werenâ€™t serving alcohol (it was Republic Day), the mocktails were fantastic, thanks to Saurav, a bartender my friend knew. The view from the top was stunning, and the rolling chairs added a fun twistâ€”though I was too scared to try them!
