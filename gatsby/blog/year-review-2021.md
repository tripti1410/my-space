## Work

When this year started I was prepared and planned that I am going to do freelancing and other side project. As the year started everything was slow moving. I didn’t have any freelancing client for my web development, so I worked on my side project up-till April. Unfortunately that didn’t worked out well. I started focusing on web development.

1. Created many codepens; participated in 6 codepen challenges. Many of them were liked by the community and featured on different places. Most appreciated pen https://codepen.io/tripti1410/pen/pordWpZ
2. There are 4-5 half done web projects 😞 I am planning to complete these projects in 2022.
3. I applied for talk to one CSS conference ([csscamp.tech](https://csscamp.tech)), unfortunately didn’t get selected.
4. Attended AAA conference in November
5. Worked with 3 clients for web development small to medium size.

> **One of the best thing that happened was I got one amazing client whose work was pretty challenging and it was the highest paying work of mine. This gave me validation for my skills and hell lot of confidence 😁. Treated myself by buying 16-inch M1 MacBook Pro 😀.**

6. Bought an iPhone as well. Now I have a well connected Apple ecosystem with MacBook, iPhone and iPad.

I learnt doodling in November 2020. And I have been practicing it throughout 2021. On average I created around one illustration a week. Find them on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/triptiscreations/).

I like to plan and organise things in general. So This year I thought of trying to use planner, One of my friend recommended planner by [Alicia Souza](https://aliciasouza.com). I like to write things down with pen and paper, hence I choose this physical planner. I am glad I bought this, I write about everyday in this as nighttime routine, do monthly planning, write summary of every month. This has helped me lot in seeing how I am spending my time, prioritizing stuff and many more.

## Books

Read three books — “Becoming”, “Words of gratitude” and “Steal like an artist”.
The best book I have read this year is **Becoming** by **Michelle Obama**. This book has so much to learn from. It has broadened my views on various aspects of life.

## Personal

It was a very tough year at a personal level. Most of the year I wasn’t well and in September I had a gallbladder removal surgery. After that few months of recovery. Emotionally it was a roller coaster ride throughout the year due to the health and personal life issues. I am glad that I stand still in this and time passed by giving me more confidence and learning for future years.

## Wrapping up

With new plans and learnings from the past year looking forward to the great year ahead.
HAPPY NEW YEAR!
